# Diwali Sales Analysis Project (Python & Google Colab)

## 📌 Project Overview
“The purpose of this project is to analyze Diwali season sales data, understand trends, and derive business insights using Python. This has been done through a Colab notebook, with a focus on data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.”

## 🔗 Live Notebook
[View & run the notebook on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/vikramdubey123/Python-Diwali-Analysis-Project/blob/main/python_diwali_sales_analysis.ipynb)

## 📊 Key Objectives & Insights
- Sales trends during Diwali period across years.  
- Top selling products during festival time.  
- Revenue growth / decline pattern.  
- Regional / category-wise performance.  
- Any interesting correlations or seasonality patterns (e.g. effect of discounts, product launches etc.).

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- pandas, numpy — data manipulation aur cleaning ke liye  
- matplotlib, seaborn (ya plotly etc.) — visualization ke liye  
- Jupyter / Google Colab environment  

## 🔍 Data Source & Preprocessing
- Data source: **https://drive.google.com/file/d/14iqcsACMf4aj3ZYoWOR0oP69339HiNjy/view?usp=sharing**  
- Cleaned for missing values, duplicates.  
- Extracted / engineered features such as year, month, product category etc.  
- Aggregation by time period / product / region etc.  

## 🧰 Repository Contents
- `python_diwali_sales_analysis.ipynb` — main notebook (analysis & visualization)  
- `data/` — folder containing source data files (if included)  
- `requirements.txt` — required Python libraries (optional, agar virtual environment bana rahe ho)  
- `README.md` — yahi file  

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Click on the Colab link above to open the notebook.  
2. If required, upload data files or connect to notebook environment.  
3. Run cells step-by-step to see data cleaning, visualizations, and insights.  
4. Modify filters / code to analyze in different ways (e.g. region-wise, product-wise).  

## 📈 Business/Use Case Value
- Helps business understand **sales behaviour during festival** to plan inventory / marketing.  
- Identify which product categories need more focus during Diwali.  
- Forecasting demand / revenue for future festivals.
